# Car Price Predictor
1. Car Price Predictor takes the parameters of an used car: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
2. It then predicts the possible price of the car with the help of linear regression.
 
For example, the image below shows the predicted price of our Hyundai Grand i10.
